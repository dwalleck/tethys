# AI (Aaditri Informatics) Framework

## Installation

The framework uses a **prompt injection method** through multiple rule files that provide comprehensive engineering guidance. **All files combined in sequence create a single comprehensive system prompt** that transforms AI assistants into sophisticated engineering partners.

```bash
# Place all framework files in your AI assistant's rules directory:

1. For Roo Code: .roo/rules/
   - Copy all framework files to this directory
2. For Cline: .cline/rules/
   - Copy all framework files to this directory
3. For Cursor: .cursor/rules/
   - Copy all framework files to this directory
4. For Claude:
   - Combine all files or use 01-best-practices.md as primary claude.md
```

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Software Engineering Best Practices

The framework implements systematic approaches to software development excellence:

#### Core Engineering Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide systems into distinct, focused components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear reason to change
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate duplication through abstraction
- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not implementations

#### Quality Attributes Focus
- **Performance**: Optimize for efficiency and scalability
- **Reliability**: Build fault-tolerant systems with graceful degradation
- **Security**: Implement security by design with proper authentication and validation
- **Maintainability**: Create easily modifiable and extensible systems
- **Testability**: Design for comprehensive automated testing

### 2. SPARC Development Methodology

Structured workflow phases ensure systematic development:

#### Task Definition & Execution
1. **Specification**: Define clear objectives, requirements, and success criteria
2. **Pseudocode**: Map logical implementation pathways before coding
3. **Architecture**: Design modular, maintainable system components
4. **Refinement**: Iteratively optimize through feedback loops
5. **Completion**: Conduct testing, documentation, and deployment

#### Agentic Integration
- **Clear Instructions**: Explicit directives with defined outcomes and constraints
- **Context Referencing**: Leverage previous decisions and learning
- **Incremental Progress**: Break complex tasks into reviewable sub-steps
- **Quality Gates**: Enforce standards through automated checks and validation

### 3. Enhanced Human-AI Collaboration

#### Intelligent Interaction Patterns
- **Confidence-Based Responses**: Collaboration level determined by AI assessment
- **Natural Communication**: Avoid rigid formats while maintaining clarity
- **Methodical Problem-Solving**: Systematic debugging and solution approaches
- **Continuous Learning**: Adapt based on experience and feedback

#### Collaborative Decision Making
- **Options Analysis**: Evaluate multiple solutions with clear criteria
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and mitigate potential issues
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Document significant choices and rationale
- **Consensus Building**: Involve stakeholders in important decisions

### 4. Advanced Problem-Solving & Debugging

#### Methodical Debugging Process
1. **Reproduce Issues**: Create reliable, minimal test cases
2. **Gather Information**: Collect logs, traces, and system state data
3. **Analyze Patterns**: Review data to understand behavior and anomalies
4. **Form Hypotheses**: Develop theories prioritized by likelihood and impact
5. **Test Systematically**: Execute tests to confirm or eliminate hypotheses
6. **Implement & Verify**: Apply fixes and validate across multiple scenarios
7. **Document Findings**: Record issues, causes, and solutions for future reference

#### Advanced Techniques
- **Binary Search Debugging**: Systematically eliminate problem space
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Look beyond symptoms to fundamental issues
- **State Snapshot Analysis**: Capture system state for intermittent issues
- **Differential Debugging**: Compare working vs. non-working states

### 5. Context Management & Knowledge Preservation

#### Session-Level Context
```
Problem: [brief description]
Requirements: [key requirements]
Decisions: [key decisions with rationale]
Status: [completed/remaining/blockers]
```

#### Project-Level Context
- **Persistent Context**: Retain relevant information across development stages
- **Decision History**: Track architectural choices and their rationale
- **Learning Integration**: Utilize historical data to refine implementations
- **Cross-Project Knowledge**: Apply patterns and lessons across initiatives

#### Documentation Standards
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant technical decisions
- **Context Management**: Maintain INDEX.md files for navigation
- **Knowledge Base**: Capture institutional wisdom and best practices
- **Session Journals**: Record detailed collaboration logs

### 6. Quality Assurance & Validation Framework

#### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Test Pyramid**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated build and test on every commit
- **Quality Gates**: Enforce standards through automated checks

#### Three-Layer Validation

**Layer 1: Pre-Development**
- [ ] Requirements clearly understood and documented
- [ ] Architecture approach validated and approved
- [ ] Potential risks and issues identified
- [ ] Success criteria and acceptance tests defined

**Layer 2: During Development**
