## Agent Workflow Setup

### MCP Documentation Created
1. **MCP-USAGE-GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide for using context7 and other MCP tools
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated with critical MCP usage section
3. **AGENT-BOOTSTRAP.md** - Enhanced with MCP references
4. **AGENT-QUICKSTART.md** - Quick reference includes MCP usage

### Key MCP Rules for Agents
- **ALWAYS** use context7 MCP for NuGet package documentation
- **NEVER** guess at API signatures or method names
- **IMMEDIATELY** check context7 for "method not found" errors
- **MANDATORY** to read MCP-USAGE-GUIDE.md before starting tasks

## Scripts Created
- `scripts/create-labels.sh` - Creates all GitHub labels
- `scripts/create-milestones.sh` - Creates GitHub milestones
- `scripts/create-all-issues.sh` - Creates all issues (with duplicate checking)
- `scripts/export-development-plan.py` - Exports tasks from DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md

## Next Steps for Agents

1. **Pick an issue** from https://github.com/dwalleck/Stratify/issues
2. **Start with Phase 0** issues (critical fixes)
3. **Use MCP tools** for any package documentation needs
4. **Follow workflows** in AGENT-BOOTSTRAP.md
5. **Track progress** using TodoWrite tool and SESSION_NOTES.md
