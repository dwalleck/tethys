# Stratify Development Session Notes

Track your daily progress here. Each session should have:
- What you completed
- What you're working on
- Any blockers
- Time spent vs estimated

## Session: 2025-07-19 17:33
### Completed
- Initial setup

### In Progress
- Review available tasks

### Blockers
- None

### Time Spent
- Estimated: N/A
- Actual: 5 minutes


## Starting TASK-001: Fix constructor argument order in EndpointGeneratorImproved
Branch: task-001-fix-constructor-order
Started: Sat Jul 19 05:38:43 PM CDT 2025

Completed: Sat Jul 19 05:53:27 PM CDT 2025
Verification: Constructor arguments are now extracted in correct order:
- HttpMethod from index 0
- Pattern from index 1

Note: Tests are failing due to generator not producing output, which will be addressed in subsequent tasks.

## Session: 2025-07-19 18:00 - Build Error Fixes
### Completed
- Fixed all 4 build errors in the solution
- Removed duplicate EndpointGenerator.cs from ImprovedSourceGenerators project
- Updated test references to use EndpointGeneratorImproved
- Updated NuGet packaging configuration
- Created PR #26 and merged to main

### Key Issues Fixed
1. Missing namespace errors (2) - Fixed by adding project reference to Stratify.MinimalEndpoints
2. Duplicate MapEndpoint method errors (2) - Fixed by removing duplicate generator

### Build Status
✅ Solution builds successfully with 0 errors

### Time Spent
- Estimated: 30 minutes
- Actual: 30 minutes

## Session: 2025-07-22 - TASK-002: Namespace Consistency Fix
### Completed
- Fixed namespace inconsistency in TestCompilationHelper.cs
  - Changed from `Stratify.MinimalEndpoints` to `Stratify.MinimalEndpoints.Attributes`
  - Generator now correctly finds endpoints using ForAttributeWithMetadataName
- Updated all test files to use HttpMethodType instead of HttpMethod
  - Updated 12 test files using sed commands
  - Fixed type mismatches in test compilations
- Added XML documentation explaining why HttpMethodType enum is necessary
  - C# attributes can only accept compile-time constants
  - ASP.NET Core's HttpMethod is a class with static properties (not constants)
  - Custom enum allows compile-time attribute usage
- Verified test improvements: 31/92 → 81/92 passing tests

### Key Technical Details
- Root cause: Generator expected `Stratify.MinimalEndpoints.Attributes.EndpointAttribute`
- Test helpers were creating attributes in wrong namespace
- HttpMethodType enum is required for attribute compatibility
- Remaining 11 failures are snapshot tests needing updated expectations

### Build Status
✅ Solution builds successfully
✅ Tests improved from 31 to 81 passing (88% pass rate)

### Time Spent
- Estimated: 1 hour
- Actual: 45 minutes
