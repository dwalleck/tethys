# Stratify Development Status

## Executive Summary

This document tracks what we've built versus what we promised in the PRD. It serves as a reality check and roadmap for completing the framework.

## Core Features Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. Core Package (`src/Stratify.MinimalEndpoints`)

- ✅ **IEndpoint Interface** - Base contract implemented
- ✅ **Endpoint Attributes**:
  - ✅ `EndpointAttribute(HttpMethodType method, string pattern)`
  - ✅ `HandlerAttribute` - Marker for handler methods
  - ✅ `EndpointMetadataAttribute` - Full metadata support
- ✅ **Base Classes**:
  - ✅ `EndpointBase<TRequest, TResponse>` - Implemented
  - ✅ `ValidatedEndpointBase<TRequest, TResponse>` - With FluentValidation
  - ✅ `SliceEndpoint` - Helper methods for common responses
- ✅ **Extension Methods**:
  - ✅ `AddEndpoints()` - DI registration
  - ✅ `MapEndpoints()` - Route registration

#### 2. Source Generators (`src/Stratify.MinimalEndpoints.ImprovedSourceGenerators`)

- ✅ **IIncrementalGenerator** implementation
- ✅ **ForAttributeWithMetadataName** for efficient discovery
- ✅ **Models** for compile-time data:
  - ✅ `EndpointClass`, `EndpointMetadata`, `HandlerMethod`, `MethodParameter`
  - ✅ `EquatableArray<T>` for proper equality
- ✅ **Basic code generation** for IEndpoint implementation

#### 3. Example API (`src/Stratify.Api`)

- ✅ Vertical slice organization demonstrated
- ✅ Features folder structure
- ✅ Integration with .NET Aspire
- ✅ Entity Framework Core setup

### ❌ Known Issues (Not Fixed)

1. **Constructor Argument Order Bug**
   - `EndpointAttribute(HttpMethodType method, string pattern)`
   - Generator extracts in wrong order (pattern at index 0, method at index 1)
   - **Impact**: Generated code uses wrong HTTP method

2. **Namespace Mismatch in Tests**
   - Tests create attributes in wrong namespace
   - Generator looks for `Stratify.MinimalEndpoints.Attributes`
   - Tests use `Stratify.MinimalEndpoints`

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Current: ~68%
   - Target: 80-90%
   - Missing: Comprehensive unit tests, cacheability tests, performance tests

### 🚧 In Progress Features

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - ✅ Basic unit tests (78 tests)
   - ✅ Some snapshot tests (17 tests)
   - ❌ Cacheability tests (for incremental compilation)
   - ❌ Performance benchmarks
   - ❌ Integration tests beyond basic

2. **Documentation**
   - ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md with class diagrams
   - ✅ SOURCE_GENERATOR.md based on Andrew Lock's guide
   - ✅ Basic README.md
   - ❌ API documentation
   - ❌ Migration guide from controllers

### 📋 Not Started (From PRD Roadmap)

#### Phase 2: Core Features

- ❌ Request/Response binding improvements
- ❌ Better validation integration beyond base class
- ❌ Enhanced metadata support
- ❌ Route constraint support

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- ❌ Versioning support
- ❌ Rate limiting integration
- ❌ Authentication/Authorization helpers
- ❌ OpenAPI schema customization

#### Phase 4: Tooling & Documentation

- ❌ Visual Studio templates
- ❌ CLI tooling for scaffolding
- ❌ Comprehensive documentation site
- ❌ Video tutorials

## Critical Path to MVP

To deliver a working MVP, we need to:

### 1. Fix Critical Bugs (Phase 0)

- [ ] Fix constructor argument order in `EndpointGeneratorImproved.cs`
- [ ] Update test helpers to use correct namespaces
- [ ] Ensure generator produces correct output

### 2. Complete Core Testing (Phase 1)

- [ ] Unit tests for all models (100% coverage)
- [ ] Unit tests for generator logic (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for full pipeline

### 3. Basic Documentation (Phase 2)

- [ ] Getting started guide
- [ ] API reference
- [ ] Example projects

### 4. Package and Publish (Phase 3)

- [ ] NuGet package configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Initial release

## Reality Check

### What Works Today

1. You can define an endpoint with attributes
2. The source generator finds it and generates code
3. The endpoint gets registered automatically
4. Basic metadata and OpenAPI integration works

### What Doesn't Work

1. Generator has wrong constructor argument order
2. Tests are incomplete and some failing
3. No route constraints or advanced features
4. No tooling or templates

### Minimum Viable Product

To have a usable framework, we need:

1. **Fix the generator bug** - Without this, nothing works correctly
2. **80% test coverage** - For confidence in the framework
3. **Basic documentation** - So people can use it
4. **NuGet package** - For distribution

## Next Steps Priority

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix constructor argument order bug
2. **HIGH**: Complete test coverage to 80%+
3. **HIGH**: Create getting started documentation
4. **MEDIUM**: Add route constraint support
5. **MEDIUM**: Create NuGet package
6. **LOW**: Advanced features (versioning, rate limiting)
7. **LOW**: Tooling and templates

## Time Estimate to MVP

Based on current state:

- Fix critical bugs: 1-2 days
- Complete testing: 3-5 days
- Documentation: 2-3 days
- Packaging: 1 day

**Total: 7-11 days to working MVP**

## Conclusion

We have built the core framework infrastructure, but critical bugs prevent it from being usable. The architecture is sound and the approach is valid, but we need focused effort on:

1. Fixing the known bugs
2. Completing the test suite
3. Writing basic documentation
4. Packaging for distribution

Once these are complete, we'll have a working minimal endpoints framework that can compete with alternatives like FastEndpoints and Carter.
