## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before Making ANY Code Changes

**MANDATORY**: Always consult project guidelines before:
- Writing any code
- Making any modifications
- Implementing any features
- Creating any tests

Key guidelines to follow:
- Required Test-Driven Development workflow
- Documentation standards
- Code quality requirements
- Step-by-step implementation process
- Verification checklists

**SPECIAL ATTENTION**: If working as part of a multi-agent team:
1. You MUST follow parallel development workflows
2. You MUST create branches and show ALL command outputs
3. You MUST run verification scripts and show their output
4. You MUST create progress tracking files

**NEVER** proceed with implementation without following established guidelines.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: MCP Tool Usage

**MANDATORY**: When working with external packages or encountering compilation errors:

1. **ALWAYS use context7 MCP** for NuGet package documentation
2. **NEVER guess** at API signatures or method names
3. **IMMEDIATELY check** context7 when you see "method not found" or "cannot convert type" errors
4. **READ MCP-USAGE-GUIDE.md** for detailed instructions

Example workflow:
```
Compilation error → Is it package-related? → Use context7 MCP
Need to use FluentValidation? → Check context7 FIRST
Unsure about TUnit syntax? → Use context7 for current docs
```

## Overview

Stratify Minimal Endpoints is a lightweight, source generator-powered framework for building vertical slice architecture APIs in ASP.NET Core. The framework uses compile-time source generation to automatically discover and register endpoints, eliminating runtime reflection and providing zero-overhead endpoint registration. It enables developers to organize their APIs using the REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) pattern, keeping all related code (request models, response models, validation, business logic) in a single location rather than scattered across multiple layers.

**Primary Implementation**: Source generators automatically generate the `MapEndpoint` implementation for classes decorated with `[Endpoint]` attributes, making manual endpoint registration unnecessary.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools Usage

**CRITICAL**: Always use MCP tools when available for enhanced capabilities. These tools provide superior functionality compared to built-in tools.

#### Available MCP Tools

1. **context7** - Library Documentation & Code Examples
   - **ALWAYS USE FOR**: NuGet package documentation, API references, method signatures
   - **When to use**:
     - Compilation errors with external packages
     - Unsure about method parameters or return types
     - Need current documentation for any library
     - Looking for code examples or best practices
   - **Usage pattern**:
     ```
     1. First call: mcp__context7__resolve-library-id with package name
     2. Then call: mcp__context7__get-library-docs with the returned library ID
     ```

2. **github** - GitHub Repository Operations
   - **When to use**: Creating issues, PRs, managing repositories
   - **Preferred over**: Manual GitHub operations

3. **fetch** - Enhanced Web Content Retrieval
   - **When to use**: Fetching web documentation or resources
   - **Preferred over**: WebFetch tool

4. **desktop-commander** - Advanced File/Process Operations
   - **When to use**: Complex file operations, process management
   - **Preferred over**: Basic Read/Write/Bash tools for complex operations

#### MCP Usage Guidelines

1. **Package/Library Issues**:
   - **FIRST ACTION**: Use context7 to get current documentation

   - Always verify package methods exist before using them
   - Check for breaking changes between versions

2. **Compilation Errors**:
   - If error involves external package: Use context7 immediately
   - Get exact method signatures and parameter types
   - Verify namespace and using statements

3. **Implementation Uncertainty**:
   - Before implementing with unfamiliar packages: Check context7
   - Look for official examples and patterns
   - Verify best practices for the specific version

4. **Common Scenarios**:
   ```
   Scenario: "Method not found" error
   Action: Use context7 to verify exact method name and parameters

   Scenario: "Cannot convert type" error with package types
   Action: Use context7 to check type definitions and conversions

   Scenario: Implementing new feature with NuGet package
   Action: First check context7 for examples and patterns
   ```

5. **Integration Workflow**:
   - Start task → Check if external packages involved → Use context7 first
   - Hit compilation error → Is it package-related? → Use context7
   - Unsure about implementation → Check context7 for examples

### Security

1. Server-Side Authority
   - Maintain sensitive logic and data processing strictly server-side.

2. Input Sanitization
   - Enforce rigorous server-side input validation.

3. Credential Management
   - Securely manage credentials via environment variables; avoid any hardcoding.

4. Threat-Aware Design
   - Apply least privilege principle: grant minimum permissions necessary for component function.
   - Implement defense in depth: multiple security layers rather than single controls.

### Version Control & Environment

1. Git Hygiene
   - Commit frequently with clear and descriptive messages.
   - Never commit directly to main branch
   - Always work on feature branches

2. Branching Strategy
   - **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each task/issue
     - Format: `task-XXX-brief-description` (e.g., `task-001-fix-constructor-order`)
     - Branch from latest main: `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b task-XXX-description`
   - **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commits
     - `fix:` for bug fixes
     - `feat:` for new features
     - `test:` for test additions/changes
     - `docs:` for documentation
     - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - **Pull Request Workflow**:
     - Complete all acceptance criteria for the task
     - Ensure all tests pass and coverage ≥ 80%
     - Push feature branch: `git push origin task-XXX-description`
     - Create pull request via GitHub UI or CLI: `gh pr create`
     - Link to the issue: "Closes #XXX" in PR description
     - Request review if working with team
     - Merge only after approval and passing CI

3. Environment Management
   - Ensure code consistency and compatibility across all environments.
   - Test locally before pushing
   - Verify CI/CD passes before marking task complete

4. Server Management
   - Systematically restart servers following updates or configuration changes.

### Documentation Maintenance

   - Apply circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.

2. Performance Optimization
   - Design for horizontal scaling through stateless architecture.
   - Apply caching strategies with consideration for cache invalidation and consistency.

### Technical Decision Documentation

1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Document significant technical decisions with context, options considered, and rationale.
   - Track architectural evolution and decision impact over time.

2. Trade-off Analysis
   - Explicitly evaluate and document technical trade-offs in autonomous decision-making.
   - Consider reversibility: prefer decisions that maintain future options when facing uncertainty.

### Legacy System Integration

1. Incremental Modernization
   - Apply strangler fig pattern: gradually replace legacy components by intercepting calls.
   - Implement anti-corruption layers between new and legacy systems for clean boundaries.

## Methodical Problem-Solving & Debugging

### Debugging Process
1. **Reproduce Issues**: Create reliable, minimal test cases
2. **Gather Information**: Collect logs, traces, and system state data
3. **Analyze Patterns**: Review data to understand behavior and anomalies
4. **Form Hypotheses**: Develop theories prioritized by likelihood and impact
5. **Test Systematically**: Execute tests to confirm or eliminate hypotheses
6. **Implement & Verify**: Apply fixes and validate across multiple scenarios
7. **Document Findings**: Record issues, causes, and solutions for future reference

### Advanced Techniques
- **Binary Search Debugging**: Systematically eliminate problem space
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Look beyond symptoms to fundamental issues

```

## Architecture

### Vertical Slice Architecture
The codebase is organized by features rather than technical layers. Each feature contains all necessary components (endpoints, models, validators, handlers) in a single folder.

Structure:
- `src/Stratify.Api/Features/{FeatureName}/` - Contains all code for a specific feature
- Each operation (Create, Get, Update, Delete) is typically in its own file
- Endpoints are registered via the `IEndpoint` interface pattern

### Project Structure
- **Stratify.MinimalEndpoints**: Core library with base interfaces and attributes
- **Stratify.MinimalEndpoints.ImprovedSourceGenerators**: Source generators for compile-time code generation
- **Stratify.Api**: Example API demonstrating vertical slice architecture usage
- **Stratify.AppHost**: .NET Aspire orchestration for local development
- **Stratify.ServiceDefaults**: Shared configuration for observability, health checks, and resilience
- **Stratify.Infrastructure**: Legacy shared code (being phased out)

### Key Patterns
1. **Source Generator-Based Registration**:
   - Classes with `[Endpoint]` attribute are discovered at compile-time
   - Source generator creates `IEndpoint` implementation automatically
   - No runtime reflection or manual registration needed
   - Generated code handles route mapping and metadata application

2. **Attribute-Driven Development**:
   - `[Endpoint(HttpMethod.Get, "/api/products")]` - Define route and HTTP method
   - `[Handler]` - Mark the method that processes requests
   - `[EndpointMetadata]` - Configure OpenAPI, authorization, tags, etc.

3. **Compile-Time Safety**:
   - Route patterns validated during compilation
   - Type-safe parameter binding
   - Early detection of configuration errors

4. **Zero-Overhead Abstraction**:
   - All endpoint discovery happens at compile-time
   - Generated code is as efficient as hand-written code
   - No runtime performance penalty

5. **Reusable Patterns**: The `Stratify.MinimalEndpoints` project contains:
   - Attribute definitions for endpoint configuration
   - Base classes for common endpoint patterns
   - Extension methods for endpoint registration
   - Source generator that creates the implementation

### Key Components

#### Attributes
- **`[Endpoint(HttpMethod, pattern)]`**: Defines HTTP method and route pattern
- **`[Handler]`**: Marks the method that handles requests
- **`[EndpointMetadata]`**: Provides OpenAPI metadata, authorization policies, etc.

#### Base Classes
- **`IEndpoint`**: Base interface for all endpoints
- **`EndpointBase<TRequest, TResponse>`**: Base class for endpoints with request/response
- **`ValidatedEndpointBase<TRequest, TResponse>`**: Base class with built-in validation
- **`SliceEndpoint`**: Simplified base class with helper methods

### How Source Generation Works

1. **Define an endpoint class**:
   ```csharp
   [Endpoint(HttpMethod.Get, "/api/products/{id}")]
   [EndpointMetadata(Tags = ["Products"], Summary = "Get product by ID")]
   public partial class GetProductEndpoint
   {
       [Handler]
       public async Task<IResult> Handle(int id, IProductService service)
       {
           var product = await service.GetByIdAsync(id);
           return product is not null ? Results.Ok(product) : Results.NotFound();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Source generator creates** (at compile-time):
   ```csharp
   partial class GetProductEndpoint : IEndpoint
   {
       public void MapEndpoint(IEndpointRouteBuilder app)
       {
           app.MapGet("/api/products/{id}", Handle)
              .WithTags("Products")
              .WithSummary("Get product by ID")
              .WithOpenApi();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Runtime registration** (one line in Program.cs):
   ```csharp
   // The MapEndpoints() extension method calls MapEndpoint() on all generated IEndpoint implementations
   app.MapEndpoints();
   ```

### Adding New Features (Example API)
1. Create a new folder under `src/Stratify.Api/Features/{FeatureName}`
2. Create an endpoint class with `[Endpoint]` attribute
3. Add `[Handler]` attribute to the handling method
4. Build the project - source generator creates the IEndpoint implementation
5. The generated code is automatically included in compilation - no manual registration needed

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: `test/Stratify.MinimalEndpoints.ImprovedSourceGenerators.Tests/` - TUnit framework
- **Snapshot Tests**: `test/Stratify.ImprovedSourceGenerators.SnapshotTests/` - Verify.TUnit
- **Integration Tests**: `test/Stratify.ImprovedSourceGenerators.IntegrationTests/`
- **Example API Tests**: `test/Stratify.Api.Tests/` - xUnit framework

## Core Engineering Principles

### Comprehensive Software Engineering Best Practices
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide systems into distinct, focused components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear reason to change
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate duplication through abstraction
- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not implementations

### Quality Attributes Focus
- **Performance**: Optimize for efficiency and scalability
- **Reliability**: Build fault-tolerant systems with graceful degradation
- **Security**: Implement security by design with proper authentication and validation
- **Maintainability**: Create easily modifiable and extensible systems
- **Testability**: Design for comprehensive automated testing

## Context Management & Knowledge Preservation

### Session-Level Context
```
Problem: [brief description + problem scope]
Requirements: [key requirements]
Decisions: [key decisions with rationale and trade-offs]
Status: [progress/blockers/next actions]
```

### Track Across Iterations:
- Original requirements and any changes
- Key decisions made and rationale
- Human feedback and how it was incorporated
- Alternative approaches considered

### Project-Level Context
- **Persistent Context**: Retain relevant information across development stages
- **Decision History**: Track architectural choices and their rationale
- **Learning Integration**: Utilize historical data to refine implementations
- **Cross-Project Knowledge**: Apply patterns and lessons across initiatives

### Documentation Standards
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant technical decisions
- **Context Management**: Maintain INDEX.md files for navigation
- **Knowledge Base**: Capture institutional wisdom and best practices
- **Session Journals**: Record detailed collaboration logs

### INDEX Maintenance:
- Update INDEX.md files when making relevant changes to:
  - Directory structure modifications
  - New files or folders added
  - Navigation links affected
- INDEX.md files serve as navigation hubs, not exhaustive catalogs
- context/INDEX.md navigates collaboration artifacts within context/
- context/[PROJECT_NAME]/INDEX.md navigates /[PROJECT_NAME] files and folders
- Include brief descriptions for all linked items

### Project Context & Understanding

1. Documentation First
   - Review essential documentation before implementation:
     - README.md
     - Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
     - Architecture documentation
     - Technical specifications
     - TODO/Task tracking files
   - Request clarification immediately if documentation is incomplete or ambiguous.

2. Architecture Adherence
   - Follow established module boundaries and architectural designs.
   - Validate architectural decisions using symbolic reasoning; propose justified alternatives when necessary.

3. Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness
   - Utilize documented technologies and established patterns; introduce new elements only after clear justification.
